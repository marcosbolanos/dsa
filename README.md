# DSA Practice repo

Since I've started my programming journey, I've found that 99% of what makes a quick and effective programmer is just drilling down the fundamentals. DSA-style exercises are a great way to grasp how core operations can be done in different languages, and I love them for that reason.

More than just writing correct code, it's important to have experience setting up the environment to run and test it. This is why I prefer doing things locally instead of using an online practice platform.

In my practice repo, you'll find :

- Exercises with commentary in languages I wanted to learn (TypeScript, C, Rust and others coming soon...)
- Tests written by myself, set up with proper testing frameworks, that show the functions are correct

**No code here is written by AI. I've used it a ton when I started, and realized it's not very useful for actually learning.**
